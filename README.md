# Classifying-Claims-vs.-Opinions-in-TikTok-Videos

The project aimed to determine whether a TikTok video presents a ‘claim’ or an ‘opinion’. The dataset comprised video like count, video comment count, video share count, view count, claim status, among other features, with the mentioned features being the most important. Developed a logistic regression model for verified status based on video features and noted that longer videos tend to be associated with higher odds of the user being verified. Built random forest and XGBoost models to classify the claims and opinions, with the random forest emerging as the champion model, achieving a recall score of 0.995. A significant difference in the average view counts between videos from verified accounts and videos from unverified accounts was noted. The challenges involved dealing with noisy data and class imbalance. Future work could investigate the root cause of the behavioral differences between verified and unverified accounts. For example, do unverified accounts tend to post more clickbait-y videos, or are unverified accounts associated with spam bots that help inflate view counts?
